            <p>Machine Learning Paper</p>
            <p>This ongoing project explores the effects of five activation functions on neural networks. The research focuses on three types: image recognition, LSTM, and a third yet to be decided.</p>

            <p>American Sign Language AI Bot</p>
            <p>This was a multi-month project in collaboration with Adam Duncan. I handled the front end and data processing (with over 200k pics for traning the model), while Adam developed an AI using TensorFlow. The Program utilized CV2 and MediaPipe to capture data from a laptop's webcam and translate sign language in real-time.</p>
